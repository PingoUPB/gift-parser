A Ruby parser for the GIFT question format.
                              
GIFT is the format used by Moodle Learning Management System for writing multiple-choice, true-false, short answer, match missing word and numerical questions. 
For details on the format see:
http://docs.moodle.org/en/GIFT

The parser is generated by Treetop parser generator. 
http://treetop.rubyforge.org/

The parser is not yet complete. It generates the syntactic tree but does not 
have all the semantic features as yet.

See the tests to get an idea on how the parser is supposed to be used.
